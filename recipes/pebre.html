    <h1> Chilean taste is so unique, so we bring PEBRE!</h1>

    <p> This pebre recipe is a South American condiment much like a salsa, made with tomato, chilies, onion, cilantro, garlic, oil and more, easy to make!</p>

    <h2>So, we learned that it's easy to make. But what do we actually need?</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>Oil, Vinegar and Water. Use 1/4 cup olive oil or a neutral oil with 1/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar. Red wine vinegar is good, too.</li>
            <li>Tomato</li>
            <li>Peppers. Use 5 Aji Chili Peppers chopped (we used Aji Amarillos) - or use jalapeno peppers or serrano peppers</li>
            <li>Onion. 1/2 small to medium-sized onion</li>
            <li>Scallions. Use 1/4 cup of the white part and 1 inch of the green parts</li>
            <li>Garlic. 4 cloves garlic, smashed to release their flavors</li>
            <li>Cilantro. Use 1/2 to 1 cup chopped cilantro, depending on your preference</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper. Use salt and pepper to your personal taste</li>         


        </ul>


    <h1> Steps to make this awesome thing are?</h1>
        <ul>

            <ol>Whisk. First, whisk together the oil, water, vinegar and smashed garlic in a large bowl until the mixture thickens up a bit.</ol>
            <ol>The Vegetables. Next, finely chop up your tomato, peppers, onion, scallions and cilantro. </ol>
            <ol>Combine. Toss the chopped onion, tomato, and vegetables into the oil mixture and mix to combine.</ol>
            <ol>Season and Refrigerate. Season with salt and pepper to your personal tastes, then transfer the mixture to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate to let the flavors mingle.</ol>
